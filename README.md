To generate the figures, clone the repository and run the scripts from within the directory on your computer.  
Scripts to generate data were tested on python 3.9.12. Libraries used in the scripts are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy.stats.  

Directory files are as follows:  

"GOOSE_master_dataframe.csv" - live cell data collected for whole cell measurements  

"summary_GOOSE.csv" - local cider parameters, medians and standard deviations of all sequence measurements  

"Main_text_live_cell_figures.py" - python script used to generate all of the figures presented in the main text
